## My step to GO!

## Git

Actually great possibility to study staff that I've missed ðŸ˜•

Fancy animation at learngitbranching was pretty verbose, yeah it expalins a lot. But, to be honest, their short solutions was tricky)

But I can't get why have you missed [documentation](https://git-scm.com/) at least in addition materials?

## Unix Shell

[Modules passed](./task_unix_shell/ "Modules")

Stuff that always was postponed and get studied from practical needs rather than intentionaly.

Kinda some basic commands was really new for me like

```bash
$ rmdir
```

Finally get full meaning from file permission assigning and managing.

Also found useful commands to manipulate with expansion in shell and I/O redirection. Yeah from I/O redirection commands like
```bash
$ awk
```
```bash
$ grep
```
From my side would like to add that bash have util called
```bash
$ envsubst
```
It can be useful even with k8s files templating
