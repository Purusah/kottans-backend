Actually great possibility to study staff that I've missed ðŸ˜•

Fancy animation at learngitbranching was pretty verbose, yeah it expalins a lot. But, to be honest, their short solutions was tricky)

Stuff that always was postponed and get studied from practical needs rather than intentionaly.

Kinda some basic commands was really new for me like

```bash
rmdir
```

Finally get full meaning from file permission assigning and managing.

Also found useful commands to manipulate with expansion in shell
